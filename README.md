# EHBEA-Models-of-cultural-evolution

Simulation code accompanying the EHBEA textbook chapter: 

****Doing violence to reality: Theoretical models of cultural evolution****

- "Rogers_sim.R" simulates Rogers' (1988) model of the evolution of social learning
- "Diffusion_sim.R" simulates the evolution of cultural traits on a (random) social network

Both scripts include some tasks in the end that help you explore the behavior of the models
